# Cursor IDE Rules for SpaceClip

## ⚠️ AUTH SYSTEM DIRECTIVE — DO NOT MODIFY

Spaceclip uses an opaque session-token authentication system.

- Session tokens are stored in the database (sessions table).
- Backend verifies tokens by DB lookups, NOT by cryptographic claims.
- Tokens are generated randomly and validated only server-side.

**Do NOT replace the existing session-token system with JWT-based login.**
**Do NOT remove or bypass the sessions table.**
**Do NOT introduce stateless authentication for primary sign-in.**

JWTs may ONLY be introduced later as:
- optional, separate authentication for enterprise SSO (Google, Azure, Okta, etc.)
- short-lived access tokens layered on top of existing sessions
- verification-only tokens issued by external IdPs

**Do NOT convert Spaceclip's internal auth system to JWTs.**
**Opaque DB-backed sessions remain the source of truth.**
